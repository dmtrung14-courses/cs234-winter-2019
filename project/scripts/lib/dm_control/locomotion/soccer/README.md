# DeepMind MuJoCo Multi-Agent Soccer Environment.

This submodule contains the components and environment described in ICLR 2019
paper [Emergent Coordination through Competition][website].

# ![soccer](soccer.png)

## Installation and requirements

See [dm_control](../../../README.md#installation-and-requirements) for instructions.

## Quickstart

```python
from dm_control.locomotion import soccer as dm_soccer

# Load the 2-vs-2 soccer environment with episodes of 10 seconds:
env = dm_soccer.load(team_size=2, time_limit=10.)

# Retrieves action_specs for all 4 players.
action_specs = env.action_spec()

# Step through the environment for one episode with random actions.
time_step = env.reset()
while not time_step.last():
  actions = []
  for action_spec in action_specs:
    action = np.random.uniform(
        action_spec.minimum, action_spec.maximum, size=action_spec.shape)
    actions.append(action)
  time_step = env.step(actions)

  for i in range(len(action_specs)):
    print(
        "Player {}: reward = {}, discount = {}, observations = {}.".format(
            i, time_step.reward[i], time_step.discount,
            time_step.observation[i]))
```

## Environment Viewer

To visualize an example 2-vs-2 soccer environment in the `dm_control`
interactive viewer, execute `dm_control/locomotion/soccer/explore.py`.
